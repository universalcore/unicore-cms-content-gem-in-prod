You may find a natural talent you never knew you had!\r\n - Encourage yourself by thinking positively instead of negatively. For example, say to yourself, \u2018I am courageous, \u2018I am beautiful\u2019 or \u2018I can do this.\u2019\r\n - Find friends and mentors who support you to develop your talents. Friends can build your self-confidence by encouraging you to keep trying even when you feel down. They also notice when you do well and celebrate with you. Surround yourself with positive friends who encourage you. \r\n - Everyone going through puberty feels strong emotions. When you are feeling overwhelmed by your emotions, it can help to take deep breaths, to do something active like dance or take a walk (if it\u2019s safe), or to find a trusted person to talk to. \r\n<p>\r\n **Living in poverty and with limited opportunities, many girls struggle to find their way. Mabreidy is one girl who felt like this. This is her story:** \r\n",
